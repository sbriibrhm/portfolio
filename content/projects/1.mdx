# Reducing Grab Ride Cancellations through Predictive UX Design

## Context

Grab faced a recurring problem: riders were canceling trips within the first few minutes after booking.  
Drivers were frustrated by long pickups, and passengers didn't trust the ETA shown on screen.

**Goal:** Improve reliability and reduce cancellations without adding more friction to the booking flow.

## Insights from Research

We discovered that:
- 45% of cancellations occurred within 3 minutes.
- Drivers were 2× more likely to cancel if pickup > 3km.
- Passengers often rebooked immediately after canceling — showing *frustration, not churn*.

## Design Intervention

We built a **predictive pairing algorithm** and added **ETA confidence messaging** to help users feel more in control.

```tsx
const isReliableMatch = (driver, distance) => {
  return driver.acceptanceRate > 0.8 && distance < 3;
};
```

## Measured Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| Cancellation Rate | 19.2% | **14.0%** | ↓ 27% |
| Trip Completion | 82% | **89%** | +7% |
| Driver Satisfaction | 4.1 | **4.5** | +0.4 |

## Reflection

> Predictive design only works when people can see why it's confident.  
> Transparency creates reliability — automation alone doesn't.
